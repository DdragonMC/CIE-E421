# CIE-E421
A mod for Derail Valley that adds the Coras Iompar Éireann E421 class diesel-hydraulic locomotive

### This mod adds the following rolling stock:
* E428 "Black & Tan" livery - spawns in City West
* E432 "Black & Tan" livery - spawns in City South
* [redacted] livery - spawns in Food Factory
* Downpatrick & Country Down "pioneering green" livery - spawns in Goods Factory
* West of Ireland Steam Railway Association "Galway Red" livery - spawns in Machine Factory

## THIS MOD REQUIRES CUSTOM CAR LOADER (https://www.nexusmods.com/derailvalley/mods/324) TO WORK

This mod may be used with the Gauge mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/derailvalley/mods/563) to achieve maximum accuracy. Select the Custom rail gauge preset and enter "1600" in the "Gauge (millimeters)" field.
This mod will run perfectly fine without Gauge installed.

## Background:
The CIÉ 421 Class were a class of fourteen diesel-hydraulic locomotives built at the Inchicore Works between 1962 and 1963, being numbered from E421 to E434, although the "E" prefix was eventually dropped.
The 421 Class was an improved redesign of the similarly-built 401 Class, fitted with a Maybach MD220 engine powering a Mekydro KL64U hydraulic transmission. Unlike the latter, the 421s were capable of multiple operation.
Although they had a designed speed of 62 mph (100 km/h), tests revealed that they didn't ride well at high speeds; this was proven by E421's derailment near Newbridge station in county Kildare. As a result, the maximum speed was restricted to 25 mph (40 km/h). For the majority of their operational lives, the 421 Class were typically employed on shunting and pilot duties until withdrawals took place between 1979 and 1983. Of the fourteen built, three are preserved:
* E421 - On static display at the Downpatrick & County Down Railway. It was operational from 1987 to 2010.
* E428 - On static display at Dunsandle station in county Galway. Initially preserved by Westrail - aka WISRA - it was then stored at Inchicore works from 1996 until 2005, when it was bought privately and relocated to Dunsandle station. Operational from 1984 to 1993.
* E432 - Currently stored at the Downpatrick & County Down Railway. It was operational from 1988 to 1998.

## Known Issues:
* The locomotive spawns with the cab light on. This resets when the electrics breaker is flipped.
* There is only one texture for the different LOD levels. This means that the locomotive will appear to have the "Black & Tan" livery from a distance, no matter the livery.
* There is no wheelslip sound.
* There are no wheelslip sparks.
* There is no wiper sound.
* Controls may not work in VR. I may add dedicated support if there is demand for it.
* The oil temperature warning light comes on prematurely.
* There is no custom buffer model.
* The HUD cannot control the rear headlights
