# CIE-E421
A mod for Derail Valley that adds the Coras Iompar Éireann E421 class diesel-hydraulic locomotive

### This mod adds the following rolling stock:
* E428 "Black & Tan" livery - spawns in City West
* E432 "Black & Tan" livery - spawns in City South
* [redacted] livery - spawns in Food Factory
* Downpatrick & Country Down "pioneering green" livery - spawns in Goods Factory
* West of Ireland Steam Railway Association "Galway Red" livery - spawns in Machine Factory

## THIS MOD REQUIRES CUSTOM CAR LOADER (https://www.nexusmods.com/derailvalley/mods/324) TO WORK

This mod may be used with the Gauge mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/derailvalley/mods/563) to achieve maximum accuracy. Select the Custom rail gauge preset and enter "1600" in the "Gauge (millimeters)" field.
This mod will run perfectly fine without Gauge installed.

Please report any bugs or issues to `#mods-support-and-bugs` channel in the Altfuture Discord Server

Known Issues:
* The locomotive spawns with the cab light on. This resets when the electrics breaker is flipped.
* There is only one texture for the different LOD levels. This means that the locomotive will appear to have the "Black & Tan" livery from a distance, no matter the livery.
* There is no wheelslip sound.
* There are no wheelslip sparks.
* There is no wiper sound.
* Controls may not work in VR. I may add dedicated support if there is demand for it.
* The oil temperature warning light comes on prematurely.
* There is no custom buffer model.
* The HUD cannot control the rear headlights
